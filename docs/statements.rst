Classes representing SQL statements
===================================

Subclasses of ``\sad_spirit\pg_builder\Statement`` represent the complete SQL statements.
Their instances are usually created by :ref:`StatementFactory methods <statement-factory>`.

All relative class and interface names below assume ``\sad_spirit\pg_builder`` prefix, which is omitted for readability.

Class hierarchy
===============

``Node``
    :ref:`Common interface <base-node>` for all nodes in Abstract Syntax Tree.

        ``nodes\GenericNode``
            :ref:`Common base class<base-generic-node>` for all implementations of ``Node`` within package.

                ``Statement``
                    Abstract base class for statements. Loosely corresponds to ``PreparableStmt`` production
                    in PostgreSQL's grammar.

                        ``Delete``
                            Represents ``DELETE`` statement.

                        ``Insert``
                            Represents ``INSERT`` statement.

                        ``Merge``
                            Represents ``Merge`` statement.

                        ``Update``
                            Represents ``UPDATE`` statement.

                        ``SelectCommon``
                            Abstract base class for ``SELECT``-type statements.

                                ``Select``
                                    Represents a simple ``SELECT`` statement.

                                ``SetOpSelect``
                                    Represents a set operator (``UNION``, ``INTERSECT``, ``EXCEPT``)
                                    applied to two ``SELECT`` statements.

                                ``Values``
                                    Represents ``VALUES`` statement. Note that this can be an independent statement
                                    in PostgreSQL, not only a part of ``INSERT``.

Clauses of SQL statements, e.g. ``WHERE`` or ``FROM``, are exposed as properties of the relevant objects.
Those properties can be writable if a corresponding ``setProperty()`` method is defined for ``$property`` and
read-only otherwise.

.. warning::

    The setter methods for properties should be considered an implementation detail, which may change in the future.
    Assign new values directly to the properties, e.g.

    .. code-block:: php

        $select->distinct = true;

    rather than via setters

    .. code-block:: php

        $select->setDistinct(true);

If the clause is a list of items, like ``FROM``, then the corresponding property is usually read-only and
is an :ref:`implementation of NodeList <base-nodelist>` and consequently ``\ArrayAccess``.
The items in the list may be modified as array offsets:

.. code-block:: php

    $select->from[0] = 'foo as bar';
    unset($select->from[1]);

.. _statements-base:

``Statement`` methods and properties
====================================

``$with: nodes\WithClause``
    A writable property that represents a ``WITH`` clause containing
    `Common Table Expressions <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/static/queries-with.html>`__
    attached to a primary statement.

``setParser(Parser $parser)``
    Sets the parser instance to use. If you add a ``Parser`` to the ``Statement`` then you'll be able to add
    parts of query as strings that will be parsed automatically.

``getParser(): ?Parser``
    Returns the parser instance, if available.

It is always possible to add query parts by creating the relevant ``Node`` implementations, but this is very tedious:

.. code-block:: php

   $select->list[] = new nodes\TargetElement(new nodes\ColumnReference('foo', 'bar'), new nodes\Identifier('alias'));

vs

.. code-block:: php

   $select->list[] = 'foo.bar as alias';

the result of the above is the same, as the string will be parsed and an instance of ``TargetElement`` added.

.. tip::

    ``Statement`` instances created by ``StatementFactory`` will have a ``Parser`` set.

``nodes\WithClause``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

This is an implementation of ``NodeList`` so individual CTEs (instances of ``nodes\CommonTableExpression``)
are accessible as array offsets. It also has a writable boolean ``$recursive`` property.

.. code-block:: php

   $select->with[] = 'foobar as (select foo.*, bar.* from foo natural join bar)';

   echo "WITH clause is " . ($select->with->recursive ? 'recursive' : 'not recursive');
   echo "Statement of first CTE is " . get_class($select->with[0]->statement);

    is essentially an array containing only instances of ``nodes\LockingElement``.

.. _statements-select-set:

Methods for set operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``SelectCommon`` also defines methods for applying set operators:

``public function union(string|self $select, bool $distinct = true): SetOpSelect``
    Combines this ``SELECT`` statement with another one using ``UNION [ALL]`` operator.

``public function intersect(string|self $select, bool $distinct = true): SetOpSelect``
    Combines this ``SELECT`` statement with another one using ``INTERSECT [ALL]`` operator.

``public function except(string|self $select, bool $distinct = true): SetOpSelect``
    Combines this ``SELECT`` statement with another one using ``EXCEPT [ALL]`` operator

If these methods are called on a ``SELECT`` statement that is a part of
some larger statement then result will replace the original statement:

.. code-block:: php

    use sad_spirit\pg_builder\{
        StatementFactory,
        Select
    };

    $factory = new StatementFactory();

    /** @var Select $select */
    $select = $factory->createFromString(
       'select foo.*, bar.* from (select * from foosource) as foo, bar where foo.id = bar.id'
    );
    $select->from[0]->query->union('select * from othersource');

    echo $factory->createFromAST($select)->getSql();

will output

.. code-block:: sql

    select foo.*, bar.*
    from (
            select *
            from foosource
            union
            select *
            from othersource
        ) as foo, bar
    where foo.id = bar.id

    instances of ``nodes\TargetElement``, it is also used for ``RETURNING`` clauses of data-modifying statements.

``$distinct: bool|nodes\lists\ExpressionList``
    ``true`` here represents ``DISTINCT`` clause, list of expressions - ``DISTINCT ON (...)`` clause.
    This property is writable.
