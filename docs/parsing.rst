Parsing SQL
===========

Parsing is done by ``\sad_spirit\pg_builder\Parser`` class backed by ``\sad_spirit\pg_builder\Lexer``.
The latter splits the SQL string into tokens, the former goes over the tokens building the Abstract Syntax Tree.

This section describes usage of these classes. An :ref:`additional section <parser-internals>` describes
implementation details that may be of interest to those trying to extend **pg_builder** in some way.

``Parser`` API
==============

.. tip::

    It is generally not necessary to manually call methods that parse SQL statements or their parts: use
    :ref:`StatementFactory::createFromString() <statement-factory-conversion>` to parse complete statements
    or :ref:`one of its builder methods <statement-factory-builders>` to create ``Statement`` instances from scratch.
    ``Statement`` instances created by ``StatementFactory`` will automatically accept strings for their properties
    and call relevant ``Parser`` methods.

It may be necessary to configure the ``Parser`` instance, however. ``Parser`` constructor accepts
an instance of ``Lexer`` (:ref:`see below <parsing-lexer>` for its configuration options) and an optional instance
of a class implementing ``CacheItemPoolInterface`` from `PSR-6 <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/>`__.

``parseSomething()`` methods
----------------------------

All public ``Parser`` methods that have ``parse`` prefix and process (parts of) SQL statements are
actually overloaded via ``__call()`` magic method. It contains code for getting / setting cache if available,
tokenizing strings with ``Lexer`` and forwarding a call to a protected method that does actual parsing work.

Several dozens of such methods are defined, e.g.

``parseStatement(string|TokenStream $input): Statement``
    Parses a complete SQL statement. Used internally by
    :ref:`StatementFactory::createFromString() <statement-factory-conversion>`.

``parseTypeName(string|TokenStream $input): nodes\TypeName``
    Parses a type name. Used by :ref:`converters\\BuilderSupportDecorator <queries>` so that it can handle any type name
    Postgres itself can.

Other ``parse*()`` methods are used by ``Node`` implementations that accept strings for their properties or array
offsets.

.. _parsing-cache:

Caching of ASTs
---------------

``Parser`` can automatically cache ASTs generated by its ``parseSomething()`` methods.
You only need to provide an instance of class implementing ``CacheItemPoolInterface`` from
`PSR-6 <https://www.php-fig.org/psr/psr-6/>`__ either to ``Parser`` constructor or
to its ``setCache(CacheItemPoolInterface $cache): void`` method.

.. code-block:: php

    $parser = new Parser(new Lexer(), new CacheImplementation());

    $parser->setCache(new AnotherCacheImplementation());

ASTs will be stored in cache under keys having ``parsetree-`` prefix.

.. tip::
    Unserializing AST is at least 4-5 times faster than creating it from SQL. Use cache if possible.

.. _parsing-lexer:

``Lexer`` API
=============

The class has only one public method

``tokenize(string $sql): \sad_spirit\pg_builder\TokenStream``
    Tokenizes the input string. Usually you don't need to call it yourself as it is automatically called by
    ``Parser`` when a string is passed to any of its ``parse*()`` methods.

You may need to set options via ``Lexer``'s constructor, however:

``'standard_conforming_strings'``
    Has the same meaning as `postgresql.conf parameter
    <https://www.postgresql.org/docs/current/runtime-config-compatible.html#GUC-STANDARD-CONFORMING-STRINGS>`__
    of the same name: when ``true`` (default), then backslashes in ``'...'`` strings are treated literally,
    when ``false`` they are treated as escape characters. Backslashes in ``e'...'`` strings are
    always treated as escape characters, of course.

.. code-block:: php

   use sad_spirit\pg_builder\Lexer;

   $strings = <<<TEST
   'foo\\\\bar' e'foo\\\\bar'
   TEST;

   $lexerStandard = new Lexer([
       'standard_conforming_strings' => true
   ]);

   $lexerNonStandard = new Lexer([
       'standard_conforming_strings' => false
   ]);

   echo $lexerStandard->tokenize($strings)
        . "\n\n"
        . $lexerNonStandard->tokenize($strings);

will output

.. code-block:: output

   string literal 'foo\\bar' at position 0
   string literal 'foo\bar' at position 11
   end of input

   string literal 'foo\bar' at position 0
   string literal 'foo\bar' at position 11
   end of input
