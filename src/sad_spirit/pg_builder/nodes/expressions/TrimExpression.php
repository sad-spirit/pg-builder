/**
 * AST node representing TRIM(...) function call with special arguments format
 *
 * Previously this was parsed to a FunctionExpression node having pg_catalog.(btrim|ltrim|rtrim) as function name.
 * As Postgres itself now outputs the original SQL standard form of the expression when generating SQL,
 * we follow the suit by creating a separate Node with SQL standard output.
 *
 * NB: we define $arguments as ExpressionList as this is what Postgres itself does (see trim_list grammar
 * production). However, passing more than two arguments will result in a "function does not exist" error and
 * thus Postgres only outputs at most two arguments when generating SQL in src/backend/utils/adt/ruleutils.c
 * Obviously, we cannot  check for function existence, so just pass on all arguments in generated SQL.
