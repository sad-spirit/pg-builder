 * AST Node representing `merge_action()` construct

 * Added in Postgres 17 together with support for `RETURNING` clauses in `MERGE` statements.
 *
 * Unfortunately, this construct can be represented neither by {@see SQLValueFunction}, as it requires parentheses,
 * nor by {@see SystemFunctionCall}, as it cannot have arguments. It is an error for it to appear
 * outside `RETURNING` clause of `MERGE` statement, so this class does not implement `FunctionLike`.
